## 🏗 The Evolution & Technical Pivot
Originally conceived as a hyper-realistic landscape, the project underwent a major logistical and design pivot to meet the demands of an international trade show.

### Phase 1: The CNC Prototype
* **Concept:** A $6' \times 6'$ foam terrain base.
* **Detail:** CNC-milled topography featuring hand-painted dirt, grass, mountains, and rivers using realistic turfs and textures.
* **The Challenge:** High shipping costs to Las Vegas, fragility of the foam, and extreme complexity in assembly.

### Phase 2: The CES Production Scale
* **Solution:** Transitioned to a high-fidelity, $6' \times 6'$ modular "Techtopia" map.
* **The Upgrade:** Scaled the map to accommodate **40+ custom 3D-printed architectural models**.
* **Focus:** Each building represents a major tech company, government entity, or academic landmark selected for its impact on the NoVa region.
